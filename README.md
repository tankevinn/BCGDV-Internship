# BCGDV-Internship

There are 2 ways on how to do a GET and POST request for BCGDV Internship Application.

First:
I created a simple Windows console application to do both GET and POST request. I have submitted the code in this repository.

Second:
I used Postman to get the key and post my data into the provided POST API endpoint.
